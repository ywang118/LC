## Description

---
```
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## Solution
---

```javascript
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    let map = {};
    for(let i =0;i<nums.length;i++){
        let num = nums[i];
        let com = map[target- num];
        if (com != undefined){
            return [com, i]
        }
        map[num] = i
    }
}
```
