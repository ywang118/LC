```javascript
var mergeTwoLists = function(l1, l2) {
let rs = new ListNode(-1);
    let head = rs;
    while(l1 !== null && l2 !== null){
        if(l1.val < l2.val){
            rs.next = l1;
            l1 = l1.next;
        }else{
            rs.next = l2;
            l2 = l2.next;
        }
        rs = rs.next;
    }
    if(l1 != null){
        rs.next = l1;
    }else{
        rs.next = l2;
    }
    return head.next;
};

```
