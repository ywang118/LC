https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal-ii/

## Description

---
```
Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its bottom-up level order traversal as:
[
  [15,7],
  [9,20],
  [3]
]
```

## Solution
---

```javascript
  var levelOrderBottom = function(root) {
    if (root == null) return [];
    let  queue = [];
    let results = [];
    queue.push(root)
    while (queue.length > 0) {
      let level = [];
      let size = queue.length
      while (size > 0){
        let current = queue.shift()
        level.push(current.val)

        if (current.left != null){
          queue.push(current.left)
        }
        if (current.right != null){
          queue.push(current.right)
        }
        size--
      }
      results.push(level)
    }
    return results.reverse()
  }
```
