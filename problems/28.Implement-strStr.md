## Description

---
```
Implement strStr().

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

```

## Solution
---

```javascript
var strStr = function(haystack, needle) {
    if (!needle) return 0
    for (let i=0 ; i<haystack.length; i++){
        if (haystack.slice(i,needle.length+i) === needle) return i
    }
    return -1
}
```
