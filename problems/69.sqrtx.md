## Description

---
```
Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Example 1:

Input: 4
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

## Solution
---

```javascript
var mySqrt = function(x) {
    let start = 0;
    let end = x;
    let res = 0;
    while(start< end){
        res = Math.ceil((start+end)/2)
        if (res * res <= x && (res + 1) * (res+1) >x) return res
        if (res * res < x ) {
            start=res
        } else {
            end = res
        }     
    }
    return res
};
```
