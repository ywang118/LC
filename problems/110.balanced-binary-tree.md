## Description

---
```
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.



Example 1:

Given the following tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]:

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
Return true.

Example 2:

Given the following tree [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]:

       1
      / \
     2   2
    / \
   3   3
  / \
 4   4
Return false.
```

## Solution
---

```javascript
var isBalanced = function(root) {
  if (root === null) return true;
  return getHeight(root) !== -1
}

let getHeight = function(node){
  if (node === null) return 0
  let left = getHeight(node.left)
  let right = getHeight(node.right)
  if (left === -1 || right === -1 || Math.abs(left-right) > 1) return -1
  return Math.max(left,right)+1
}
```
