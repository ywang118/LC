## Description

---
```
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:

Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
Follow up:

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
```

## Solution
---

```javascript
var maxSubArray =function(nums) {
  let maxTocurr = nums[0],
      max = nums[0]
  for (let i =1; i<nums.length; i++){
    maxTocurr = Math.max(maxTocurr+ nums[i], maxTocurr)
    max = Math.max(max, maxTocurr)  
  }
  return max
};
```
