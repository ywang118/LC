## Description

---
```
Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:

    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3


But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:

    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3


Note:
Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.
```

## Solution

```javascript
  var isSymmetric = function(root) {
    if (!root) return true
    return isSymmetricHelper(root.left, root.right)
  }

  const isSymmetricHelper= function(left, right){
    if (!left && !right) return true;
    if (!left || !right) return false;
    return (left.val === right.val &&
            isSymmetricHelper(left.left, right.right) &&
            isSymmetricHelper(left.right, right.left))
  }
```
